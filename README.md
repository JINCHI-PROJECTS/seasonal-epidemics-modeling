# Modeling Seasonal Influenza and COVID-19 Co-circulation

This project simulates the co-circulation of influenza and COVID-19 using a SEIRS model, incorporating vaccine intervention timing. It applies the next-generation matrix method to estimate R₀ and evaluates different vaccination scenarios.

## Methods
- SEIRS compartmental model
- Parameter calibration from literature
- Vaccine timing sensitivity analysis

## Tools
- R, MATLAB

## Outputs
- Time-series plots of infections
- R₀ estimation tables

## Supervision
This work was completed under the guidance of Prof. Katie Glass and A/Prof. Pierre Portal at ANU.
